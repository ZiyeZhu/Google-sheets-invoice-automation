    Date Handling: Formatting dates as dd/MM/yyyy using JavaScript's Utilities.formatDate

    Sheet Manipulation:

        getLastRow(), appendRow(), and getRange() to interact with specific cells and rows

        Updating other sheets based on input from one main form

    Logging & Debugging: Logger.log() used to trace actions and ensure script runs correctly
